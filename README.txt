Instructions for compiling insertsort.py, mergesort.py, insertTime.py, and mergeTime.py

1. Transfer all files and the data.txt file that will be read in for insertsort.py and mergesort.py
to the flip server. 
2. On flip call python3 insertsort.py and a file named insert.out will contain the sorted
contents of data.txt.
3. On flip, call python3 mergesort.py and a file named merge.out will contain the sorted
contents of data.txt.
4. For insertTime.py, open the file using vim insertTime.py and update the value for n 
to represent the number of randomly generated integers to be sorted.
5. Once the value is updated, call python3 insertTime.py and the number of elements in the array
as well as the running time will be printed to the terminal.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the desired number of running time data points have been collected.
7. For mergeTime.py, open the file using vim mergeTime.py and update the value for n 
to represent the number of randomly generated integers to be sorted.
8. Once the value is updated, call python3 mergeTime.py and the number of elements in the array
as well as the running time will be printed to the terminal.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 until the desired number of running time data points have been collected.
